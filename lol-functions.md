## chapter 3

eq
    check two symbols for equality
expt

/
    division, returns rational number with ints
    returns fraction with floats
princ
    print stuff, human-readable
cons
    glue two objects together
car
    get head of list
cdr
    get tail of list
    to repeat, add more d's
    if car and cdr are combined, read from right to left
list
    create a list

## chapter 4

if
    usual if branch
oddp
    T if odd number as argument given
progn 
    chain several evaluations together
    only the last result will be returned
when
    if plus implicit progn
    will only evaluate true progn branch
unless
    if not plus implicit progn
    will only evaluate false progn branch
cond
    can work with several conditionals
    will evaluate all branches
case
    match parameter with symbol
    will break with strings
and
    boolean stuff
or
    boolean stuff
member
    contains function for lists
null
    check for nil
equal
    check everything else, not being a symbol
eql
    symbols, numbers, characters
equalp
    compare strings with different caps
    compare ints and floats
=
    numbers
string-equal
    strings
char-equal
    chars

## chapter 5

assoc
    return car and cdr consed from the matching car from an associated list / alist
    only returns first match
apply
    apply a function to a list of arguments
mapcar
    apply a function to every element of a list
append
    joins lists into a single big list
find
    search a list for a item and return it if present
push
    add element to front of list

## chapter 6

print
    to console
prin1
    print to console, without prepending a newline
read
    from console, needs quotes for strings
read-line
    get all till enter as a string
eval
    evaluate string/whatever as code
loop
    loop forever
read-from-string
    get syntax expression
quote
    '

## chapter 6.5

lambda
    define anonymous functions
    it's actually not a function, but a macro

. 
    dot operator for creating dotted lists, if needed

alphanumericp
    check if char in string is alphanumeric
complement
    return complement function of a given function
mapc
    same as mapcar, more efficient, doesnt return result list
with-open-file
    define 'stream variable'
    open file handler for writing files
ext:shell
    call shell commands
funcall
    todo
maplist
    apply a function to a remainder of a list (think mapcar plus application on all following elements)

## chapter 8

load
    import lisp code from another file
loop repeat n
    loop n times
loop for n from a to b
    loop for b-a times, making the index available
collect
    used in loop statements, to tell which elements shall be put into a list
    takes function arguments, too
loop for i below n
    loop from 0 to n-1
mapcan
    all lists generated by map are appended into one big list
intersection
    tells which elements are shared by two lists
    the equals function to be used can be specified
set-difference
    returns all items that are present in the first list but not the second
remove-duplicates
    removes duplicates from a list

## chapter 9

make-array
    create an array
aref
    reference an array by index
setf
    prepend to getters for setting variables
make-hash-table
    create a hashtable
gethash
    get item for given key
nth
    get nth element of a list
round
    round off a number
values
    define return values (can be several at once!!)
multiple-value-bind
    use several value-defined values at once, instead of just the first one
time
    time a function call, just like in bash
dotimes
    repeat for the given amount of times
defstruct
    create object
length
    return length of list/string/array
list-length
    return length of string
find-if
    finds first value to satisfy a predicate
count
    how often an object exists in a sequence
position
    return first position of an object occurrence
some
    T if an object satisfies predicate in a given sequence
every
    T if every object in a given sequence fulfills the predicate
reduce
    = foldleft
map
    apply function to every element of ssequence, return result as given type
subseq
    return subsequence between two given indexes, including start excluding the end
sort
    sequence by function
arrayp
    T if array
characterp
    T if char
consp
    T if cons
functionp
    T if function
hash-table-p
    T if hash-table
listp
    T if list
stringp
    T if string
symbolp
    T if symbol
defmethod
    declare generic function acception different types (type dispatching)
truncate
    return result of integer division, and remainder
type-of
    return type
decf
